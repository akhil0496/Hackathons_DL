## Description 
It is difficult to keep track of changing abundance of insect biomass with sufficient accuracy. Current solutions include identifying specimens captured by camera traps manually, a process which can be time consuming as well as labour intensive. Thus improved methods are needed. Automated image classification using machine learning is one such approach.

The D-Tribe Community challenges the participants to build an algorithm to help classify habitus images of ground beetles to species level. This dataset consists of 291 species spread across 57,027 train images and 6,337 test images.

## Evaluation
The evaluation pages describes how submissions will be scored and how you should upload your submission in this hackathon.

The evaluation metric for this competition is Mean F1-Score. The F1 score, commonly used in information retrieval, measures accuracy using the statistics precision p and recall r. Precision is the ratio of true positives (tp) to all predicted positives (tp + fp). Recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives (tp + fn). The F1 score is given by:

### F1=2pâ‹…rp+r  
where  
#### p=tptp+fp,  
#### r=tptp+fn
The F1 metric weights recall and precision equally, and a good retrieval algorithm will maximize both precision and recall simultaneously. Thus, moderately good performance on both will be favored over extremely good performance on one and poor performance on the other.
